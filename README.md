## 🧠 AI & Intelligent Systems Developer | Turning "What If" Into Reality  

I’m a developer who thrives on the intersection of **AI, web technology, and creativity**.  
I believe technology is at its best when it’s human-focused — when it empowers people to do more, connect better, and create without limits.  

I’m not just here to write code.  
I’m here to **design systems** that solve real problems, challenge old ways of thinking, and open new possibilities for creators, teams, and communities.  

---

### 🌟 Current Focus
Right now, I’m running **Ganymede Intelligent Systems**, my own little innovation lab.  
My main project is **ArtMunchie** — an art discovery platform built around *fairness* and *authentic connection*.  

On ArtMunchie:
- Artists don’t have to game algorithms or chase trends.  
- Discovery is powered by **vector-based recommendations**, which means the art you see is actually similar to what you love — not just what’s popular.  
- A built-in virtual currency (*cookies*) lets fans directly support artists instantly, with no hidden fees or delays.  

In short: I’m trying to make the *fairest possible* way for artists to get discovered, and for audiences to explore art they’d never find otherwise.

### 💡 What Drives Me
- **Building for people, not just numbers** — Tech should enhance lives, not just optimize metrics.  
- **Leveling the playing field** — Whether it’s artists, small businesses, or indie devs, I want to give them the same tools and reach big players have.  
- **Curiosity first** — Every “what if?” is a potential project. I love chasing ideas others might call impossible.

---

### 📚 Always Learning
I’m constantly exploring new tech stacks, concepts, and AI models to push my work further.  
Right now, I’m diving deeper into:
- **Svelte & SolidJS** for ultra-fast, reactive UIs  
- **Multimodal AI** for bridging text, images, and other data  
- **Hybrid recommendation systems** (my thesis topic)

### 🎯 Fun Facts About Me
- 🕹 Can spend hours tweaking UI animations for that perfect *feel*  
- 🧗 Loves bouldering (currently training for harder routes)  
- 📚 Can deep-dive into AI papers for fun (yes, really)  
- 🌏 Based in Indonesia, always curious about global tech communities
